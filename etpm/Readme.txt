This is the tissue probability maps presented in this reference:
Lorio et al., 2016, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.01.062

NOTE:
The original maps provided at the time were not meeting SPM's requirements:
	nwTPM_sl2.nii

I fixed the TPM using the script: cp_update_TPM.m
This lead to the currect "extended TPM" : 
	eTPM.nii
